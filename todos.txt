so we will start timer when user starts typing and we will stop when time duration is over
meanwhile we need a way to automatically load new text when previous text is over
so, basically import export is for standard ES6 i.e. js in browser
and require() is for commonjs like node on server side
when promise is resolved then I should run the logic part
until the promise gets resolved we will show some loading animation
need to move some initialization to top

Todos:
- serving up text dynamically
- refer other's code and videos to find out how the heck js files will communicate and how to keep backend and browser js files separate
- try using express server, and see if that could serve up local files and can import other js files
- test out sound packs
- code refactoring and use of classes
