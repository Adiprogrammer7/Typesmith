so we will start timer when user starts typing and we will stop when time duration is over

Todos:
- add time constraint feature
- refer other's code and videos to find out how the heck js files will communicate and how to keep backend and browser js files separate
- try using express server, and see if that could serve up local files and can import other js files
- test out sound packs
- code refactoring and use of classes
